## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Abraham.

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm an AI Engineer/researcher passionate about reserach and development of scalable AI solutions, with a focus on large language models (LLMs), computer vision and AI applications to power systems. 

## ðŸš€ Current Focus
- **LLM Optimization:** Fine-tuning and deploying production-ready LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., with Triton, TGI, vLLM, SGLang)
- **AI for Sustainability:** Developing ML models for energy forecasting, solar panel defect detection, and predictive maintenance
- **Scalable Inference:** Building high-performance serving systems (dynamo, SGLang) for low-latency AI applications

## ðŸ”§ Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), MATLAB, R
- **ML/LLM Stack:** Transformers, XGBoost, NLP, RL, LoRA/PEFT fine-tuning
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, GCP, Docker, Triton Inference Server, Nvidia dynamo, ONNX
- **Research:** Time-series forecasting, computer vision, generative AI

## ðŸ“š Background
- PhD in Functional Control Systems with a focus on AI applications in sustainable infrastructure.

## ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact
- I love reading AI research papers and reproducing their methodologies. 
- Enjoy cracking hard AI optimization problems like increasing throughput and reducing latency.
